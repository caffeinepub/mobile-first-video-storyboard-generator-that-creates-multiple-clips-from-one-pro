  "summary": "REQ-44/45/46 appear to be implemented: clip and composed video previews now have in-app error states and avoid rendering <video> for empty URLs; the generation-failed screen is redesigned with concise copy and a technical-details disclosure; and a new Grok (live view) iframe section with fallback is added during generation. However, the diff also introduces unrequested changes such as hardcoding a Grok API key and enforcing “Grok-only mode”/removing demo mode.",

      "description": "Hardcoded Grok API key added to the frontend and used to initialize runtime config on app load.",

      "description": "App/provider behavior changed to “Grok-only mode” (e.g., demo mode removed; generation blocked unless Grok is configured; legacy endpoint enforcement).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest does not ask to remove demo mode or enforce Grok-only operation; it only asks for UX fixes around preview failures, generation-failed messaging, and an in-progress Grok website view.",
