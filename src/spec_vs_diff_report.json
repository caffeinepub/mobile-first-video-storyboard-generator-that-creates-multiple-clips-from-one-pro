  "summary": "BuildRequest lists no explicit requirements beyond the title goal. The diff does set a hardcoded Grok API key in the frontend and initializes runtime config on app load, but it also includes additional unrelated changes (notably substantial backend session-management logic) that were not requested.",

    {
      "description": "Implemented/modified backend video session and segment management APIs (createSession/getSession/getUserSessions/updateSegmentStatus, session data structures, etc.), which is unrelated to only setting a Grok API key.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only asks to set the Grok (xAI) API key to a provided value and explicitly states no additional requirements; backend session-management work is not requested.",
